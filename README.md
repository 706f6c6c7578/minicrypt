# minicrypt

The world's easiest to use public key encryption program,  
which produces no meta-data.ðŸ˜Š

For deterministic key pair generation I recommend [red](https://github.com/706f6c6c7578/red)  
and for vanity key pairs I recommend [ve](https://github.com/706f6c6c7578/ve), which can be  
converted to PEM format with [hex2pem](https://github.com/706f6c6c7578/hex2pem).
